		<h2>Of Beauty</h2>
		<p>Virtue is like a rich stone, best plain set; and surely virtue is best, in a body that is comely, though not of delicate features; and that hath rather dignity of presence, then beauty of aspect.</p>
		<p id="positioned">Neither is it almost seen, that very beautiful persons are otherwise of great virtue; as if nature were rather busy, not to err, than in labor to produce excellency.</p>
		<p>And therefore they prove accomplished, but not of great spirit; and study rather behavior, than virtue.</p>
